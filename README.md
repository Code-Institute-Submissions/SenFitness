 Manual Testing

 I made sure the site was responsive and functional on all screen sizes so I made sure to use developer tools to look through the site on each screensize.

 There is a bug in the code causing the site to be wider than the screen width. If I had more time i could figure this out. this is the reason why the site on smaller screen sizes isnt covering the whole width of the screen and the navbar isnt sticking to the page till the end of the scroll.

 Deployment

 This project was produced on GitHubs Gitpod which is a local IDE.
